	<h1>Classification schemes and taxonomies</h1>
	<br>
Classification schemes group items together based on common characteristics.  They are often hierarchical in nature and typically provide a code for each class and are used in a wide variety of contexts, for example, libraries and medicine.  <br>
<br>
Taxonomies provide intellectual structures which arrange things into groups and subgroups according to predetermined rules and ensure that the groups and subgroups are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities.  Again their use is widespread and can be found in biology and pharmaceutics.<br>
<br>
From these two definitions we can see that they are near synonyms.<br>

	<h1>Records classification schemes and taxonomies for recordkeeping</h1>
	<br>
So far we have focused on the generic terms but now let\'s consider what they mean when they are applied to records and recordkeeping.<br>
<br>
<i>Records classification schemes</i><br>
Records classification schemes categorise records in a systematic and consistent way.  Classification also covers file naming conventions, security restrictions and access rights.<br>
<br>
Traditionally the classification scheme was probably called a file plan and was based on organisational structure in the days when organisational change did not happen on a frequent basis.  So the records for each office, which would be principally on paper, would be filed and managed together and not necessarily related to similar records series covering common functions like financial and personnel management.  <br>
<br>
Nowadays best practice recommends that the classification scheme is based on an analysis of the functions, activities and transactions of the organisation.  So the focus changes from the records as physical objects to be organised and stored to the transactions which produce the records.<br>
<br>
<b>List below the reasons for this change in approach.</b>
		<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>
			<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON class="RightButt" OnClick="DisplayAnswerBox(1);" VALUE="Check Response">
		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide1" >
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
The reasons for this are that 
1.	organisational change has become the norm while the nature of the work that the organisation remains constant 
2.	the majority of records today are created and live out their whole lives as digital objects and therefore need to be linked to the transaction form which they result when they are captured into the recordkeeping systems.  

			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
So a classification scheme based on functions becomes essential for electronic recordkeeping to ensure that all records are captured and connected to the business transaction from which they result.  The classification scheme is the foundation of an electronic recordkeeping system providing the framework for capturing the evidence of business transactions and for building the institutional memory. <br>
<br>
<i>Taxonomies for recordkeeping</i><br>
Recordkeeping taxonomies are a phenomenon of the electronic recordkeeping environment.  They provide a mapping of the functions, activities and transactions of an organisation as a series of categories, sub categories and sub sub categories.  They establish records management properties for each of the categories and create containers into which groups of records can be placed.  When a record is captured into one of the containers it inherits the properties of the container, for example, retention periods and security restrictions.  <br>

	<h1>Role and purpose of records classification schemes and taxonomies for recordkeeping</h1>
	<br>
Having established what records classifications schemes and taxonomies are we can now consider what are their roles and purpose.<br>
<br>
<b>List below the roles and purpose of records classification schemes</b>
		<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>
			<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON class="RightButt" OnClick="DisplayAnswerBox(1);" VALUE="Check Response">
		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide1" >

			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=6>
Records classification schemes are typically used:
- To file active records
- To link related records together
- To retrieve active records in the office of origin, or 
- As a finding aid for archives.
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
Records classification schemes categorise records in a systematic and consistent manner which facilitates their capture, retrieval, maintenance and disposal.  They also establish final naming conventions, security restrictions and access rights to records.<br>
	<br>
	Taxonomies for recordkeeping have two main purposes as follows:<br>
	<OL>
<li>to identify and retrieve records within and across business units
<li>to organise records to facilitate the implementation of corporate records management policies
</OL>
<br>
So taxonomies fulfil many of the roles of a records classification scheme but have a wider remit.  As stated above they provide the foundation for recordkeeping establishing the business transactions which need to be recorded, the framework for implementing retention and controls for monitoring the implementation of the recordkeeping policy and programme.<br>
<br>
And finally some key points to remember about records classification schemes and taxonomies:<br>
<ul>
<li>Records classification schemes provide hierarchical systems for capturing, storing and retrieving records
<li>Nowadays records classification schemes are structured round the functions, activities and transactions of an organisation
<li>Taxonomies for recordkeeping have emerged in the electronic environment as the framework for implementing corporate records management policies
</ul>
