<h1>Principles of records destruction</h1>
<br>
Very few records created by any part of the organisation will have the kind of value which warrants their permanent retention as historical archives.  All other records (possibly as many as 95%) need to be destroyed securely in a controlled manner. This is not only good practice but it is essential to complete the recordkeeping cycle.<br>
<br>
Destruction is the act of destroying records, regardless of media, according to appropriate procedures which ensure they are no longer accessible and as we have indicated above is the ultimate fate or the final stage of the life cycle for the majority of records. In records management terminology destruction is also referred to as disposal.  Disposal is one of the two options covered by records disposition, another records management term, with the other being transfer to archives.<br>
<br>
So let\'s begin by considering reasons for destroying records.<br>
<br>
<b>List reasons for destroying records:</b>
<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>

		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide1" >
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=10>
There are many good reasons for destroying records promptly when they are no longer needed:
- To ensure best practice and confidence in the recordkeeping program
- To demonstrate accountability and consistency in implementing destruction decisions 
- To reduce maintenance costs
- To prevent records which are no longer needed from slowing down the system (this is particularly relevant to searching for electronic records)
- To eliminate unnecessary storage costs
- To eliminate any risk of sensitive or personal information falling into the wrong hands

			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
An organisation\'s records are destroyed when they have reached the end of their retention period and destruction happens according to policies and procedures to ensure that it is properly authorised and documented. <br>
<br>
The  principles which govern records destruction at the UN specify that records destruction should be:<br>
<br>
<OL>
<LI>Authorised by both the Archives and Records Management Section (ARMS) (through the retention schedule and final sign-off) and by the business unit\'s internal approval process
<LI>Appropriate (irreversible and environmentally friendly)
<LI>Secure/Confidential 
<LI>Timely  
<LI>Documented (so that there is a record of what has been destroyed by what authority and surety that the record(s) have really been destroyed) 
</OL>

<h1>Knowing which records to destroy</h1>

Since we agree that some records may be destroyed how would you work out whether specific records files or boxes should be destroyed? <br>
<br>

Essentially there are two main ways to work out which and when records should be destroyed:
- It is stipulated in the retention schedules
- There is an agreement between ARMS and the originating office which normally occurs when the records are transferred to ARMS

<i>Using Retention Schedules to Manage Destruction </i>	<br>
Retention schedules are used to govern how long you should keep your records and what happens to them at the end of the cycle. Although the cycle may involve several stages of transfer to different storage areas (office space, local archives, ARMS storage facilities), at the end of the cycle records are either designated as archives or they are destroyed.  Records retention schedules are therefore the instruments which provide the formal disposition authorisation upon which a business unit can act.	<br>
	<br>
Retention schedules give disposition instructions for groups of records.  In the partial schedule given below, there are two activities LOG001.P - Policy and procedure and LOG002.P - Reporting to UNHQ with some details in the Notes field about the related groups of record. 	<br>
	<br>
<center><img src="'.$GLOBALS['base_url'].'/'.$GLOBALS['theme_path'].'/images/ELearn/Image163.jpg" ></center><br>
<br>
<b>Using the retention schedule above as you guide, indicate if the records to either of either of these can be destroyed.</b><br>
<br>
<b>- LOG001.P	 Policy and procedure </b>
<div CLASS="TextareaBox">

			<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON class="RightButt" OnClick="DisplayAnswerBox(2);" VALUE="Check Response">
		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide2" >
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5>
LOG001.P: the records relating to Policy and procedure are transferred to the local archive when closed and should be transferred to the Permanent Archive 1 month after the End of Mission Mandate. These records should not be destroyed! 
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
<b>- LOG002.P	Reporting to UNHQ.</b>
<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>

		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide3" >
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
LOG002.P: Reporting to the UN, is also transferred to the local archive when closed. However, as the schedule clearly states, "Destroy Permitted", so the records can be destroyed either 3 years after they are closed or 1 month after the end of the mission.

However what do you do if you don\'t find a record series on the retention schedule used by your office? In the box below fill in the action you would take.<br>

			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
Check with other staff in the office to see if there is a schedule you are not aware of or if the records were previously called by a different name. 

If there appears to be no relevant retention schedule to cover the record series maintained in your office, you should contact ARMS staff to discuss establishing a retention schedule or to check if the series is covered by an existing schedule.

<h1>When to Destroy Records </h1> 
<br>
Records should not be destroyed while there is still a need for them but they should not be kept any longer than is necessary for legal, regulatory or business reasons. Records are usually destroyed when they have reached the end of a specified retention period, as discussed above. However, before destroying records, you must ensure that the records are no longer required by your business unit which is responsible for authorizing destruction.<br>
<br>
If your retention schedule states "Destroy Permitted", you may destroy records without further approval from ARMS. However, remember that the disposal schedules set a minimum period for retention, and it is possible that the records may need to be kept for longer.   If your office identifies a business need to retain the records longer, you have the authority to do so.<br>

You must have good security in place at all times prior to destruction to ensure the information is safeguarded against loss, unauthorised access, use or disclosure. You should transport the records in lockable containers and/or in totally enclosed and lockable vehicles. They should be destroyed in the presence of an officer of your business unit. For extra security, sensitive records may also be shredded in-house before being sent for pulping.

Be sure that the contract specifies:

- Suitably secure transport for the records
- That records are destroyed immediately on receipt at the contractors’ premises (or at least that the contractor can guarantee their security if this is not possible)
- Acceptable methods of destruction
- Confirmation of documentation to be provided

		<br>
Whilst contractors can be engaged to destroy records, it is the responsibility of the business unit to ensure that destruction occurs in accordance with the approved methods of destruction. Make sure you know what method of destruction your contractor is using. <br>
<br>
<i>Transport of records</i><br>
The contractor can collect records from your office for destruction, or you can deliver the records to them. A closed truck should be used whenever possible. However, if there is no alternative and the contractor can only provide an open truck, ensure that the load is secured by a cover. Sensitive and confidential records should only be conveyed in a closed and locked vehicle
<br>
<i>Documentation</i><br>
Always insist on a certificate of destruction. If records that were supposed to be destroyed are subsequently found, the certificate is evidence that the contractor was at fault, not your business unit. You may also want to request that the certificate of destruction includes the method used. <br>

			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
False: 
Destruction is the act of destroying records, regardless of media, according to appropriate procedures which ensure they are no longer accessible. Disposal is a synonym for disposal, However, disposition is the records management term for actions and processes to which records are subject at the final stage of their lifecycle i.e. destruction and transfer to archives.

			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
False: 
There are many good reasons for destroying records promptly when they are no longer needed. These include:
- To ensure confidence in the recordkeeping program;
- To demonstrate accountability;
- To prevent records with no continuing usefulness from slowing down the system;

			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
				<b>3. The retention schedules set a minimum period for retention, however it is possible that the records may need to be kept for longer.</b>

			<OPTION VALUE="1"  >True</OPTION>
			<OPTION VALUE="2"  >False </OPTION>

		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide3">
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
True:
it is possible that the records may need to be kept for a longer period if:
- Your business unit still has a business or administrative needs for the records

		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide4">
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=10>
False: 
Action can be taken if a record series is not on schedule. First you can check with other staff in the office to see if there is a schedule you are not aware of or if the records were previously called by a different name. If there appears to be no relevant retention schedule to cover the record series maintained in your office, you should contact ARMS staff to discuss establishing a retention schedule or adding the series to any appropriate existing schedule.
