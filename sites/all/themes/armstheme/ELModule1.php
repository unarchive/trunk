		<h1>Record and Information Matters in the United Nations </h1>
		<br>
		Welcome to the introductory module of the recordkeeping elearning programme. Its aim is to raise awareness on recordkeeping for all UN staff and addresses the following topics:
		<br>
		<UL>
			<li>	Drivers for recordkeeping in the United Nations </li>
			<UL>
				<li>	Why are records important for the United Nations? </li>
				<li>	Why are records important for you?</li>
			</UL>
			<li>Some definitions</li>
			<li>	Identifying records</li>
			<li>	Establishing how long to keep records</li>
			<li>	Understanding the lifecycle of a record</li>
			<li>	UN recordkeeping framework</li>
			<li>	UN rules for recordkeeping - your responsibility</li>
			<li>	Test learning</li>
		</UL>
		<br>
		Today we live in the information age and within the United Nations we rely on the information and records that staff members create and receive:
		<ul>
			<il>to carry out our work effectively and efficiently</il>
			<il>to provide evidence of what we have done for our stakeholders and </il>
			<il>to preserve for future generations the history of the Organisation.</il>
		</ul>

		But not all information and records have the same value and only a small proportion (less than 10%) make up the future archives on the UN.  Also in the past this information and records were in paper format but today they include an ever growing and diverse range of data files and databases, word processing files, electronic mail and messages, and other digital text or numeric information which challenges traditional methods of creating, managing and maintaining records.  However the basic principles and objectives of good recordkeeping do not change but the methods, practice and roles do.<br>
		<br>
		The Archives and Records Management Section (ARMS) is tasked to design and implement an archives and records management programme to ensure that information is available when needed and for as long as needed and at the least possible cost.  In order to do this and to help you to understand more about the basic principles of recordkeeping within the UN and your roles and responsibilities ARMS has developed this introductory learning module for all staff.  It will take no longer than 30 minutes to complete and you will also get a chance to test your learning.<br>

		Let\'s begin by considering the role and importance of records and recordkeeping within UN by answering the following four questions.  In each case give your answer and then compare with the responses provided<br>

		<b>Why are records important for the United Nations?</b><br>

The records of the United Nations are important because they tell us what, where and when something was done and why and how a decision was made.  They tell us who was involved, in what capacity and under what authority.  They can also be used to develop lessons learned now and by future generations who will use them as archives.  In other words records provide evidence of and information about the activities of the United Nations supporting current work as well as for future reference.

Records are important for you because
o they help you do your work more efficiently
o they capture lessons learned and knowledge for you to use
o they enable you to meet accountability obligations applicable to your work
o they protect the interests of the United Nations
o they protect your interests as an employee of the United Nations.

		<h1>Some definitions</h1>
		<br>
		So we\'ve established that records are important for the organization and for UN staff members but we now need to make sure that we understand some key terms.<br>
		<br>
		We\'ve already talked about information, records and archives but what about documents.  Do all of these terms mean the same thing or if not what is the difference?  Also do any of the terms have a special meaning within the UN?<br>
		<br>
		<b>What do you think?  Write in the space below what you understand by information, documents, records and archives then check your response.</b><br>

Information is facts and figures in context.  So far example the current population of France on 1 January 2006 according to INSEE is 62 886 171.  Information can be in many forms, paper and electronic, and of many types, public, official or personal.

Documents can also be in many forms and contain information of many types.  They are different from information in that they have a definite structure e.g. an essay, a draft report.  Within the UN, the term  UN \'documents\' mean official publications of the organization.

Like documents records contain information and they have a structure but what distinguishes records from documents is the fact they are the output of a completed business transaction.  They are created or received by the organization as a result of UN official business.  UN records are all records, regardless of physical form, created or received by a member of the Secretariat in connection with or as a result of the official work of the United Nations. This does not include UN documents which are considered as official publications.

And finally archives and in particular UN archives are records to be permanently preserved for their administrative, legal, historical and informational value.

		<h1>Identifying records</h1>
		<br>
		Having established definitions it is then important to be able to recognize which items are records and which are not as records need to be managed in a particular way.<br>
		<br>
		So let\'s look at a list of examples and choose which are records and which are not.  The current definition for records within the UN is:<br>
		<br>
		"any data or information, regardless of its form or medium, maintained by the United Nations as evidence of a transaction" (ST/AI/2006/XXX Recordkeeping and the Management of Un Archives)<br>
		<br>
		<b>So using this definition as your guide, select the relevant option from the dropdown list and in each case indicate why. Then check your response.</b><br>

This is an impractical solution in both the paper and electronic world.

These records are called vital records and because of their importance need to be identified and protected i.e. backup copies made and kept at a separate location.  Some records remain vital through out their life e.g. UN Charter but others are vital for a fixed period e.g. current staff list, contract until completed.  Typically they represent less than 10% of the records of a business unit.

		<h1>Understanding the lifecycle of a record</h1>
		<br>
		A key concept of recordkeeping is the idea that we can compare the existence of groups of records to a series of life stages<br>
		<ol>
			<li>they are created or received by a UN staff member carrying out their job</li>
			<li>they live an active life when they have high value and use and remain close to those who created them</li>
			<li>they then become less active with reducing value and can be transferred from the creating or receiving office to a storage facility</li>
			<li>finally they are retired and become archives or are destroyed.</li>
		</ol>
		We can represent this as a diagram - see below<br>
		<center><img src="'.$GLOBALS['base_url'].'/'.$GLOBALS['theme_path'].'/images/ELearn/Image116.jpg" ></center><br>
		This lifecycle provides a structure for managing records and also can be used to show how responsibilities for the different stages are shared between all staff and ARMS.  So which stages are the responsibility of UN staff, which are shared between ARMS and UN staff and which are the responsibility of ARMS only?<br>

		But the lifecycle is only part of what is needed for an effective and efficient framework for what else is needed and these roles and responsibilities fall to other groups.<br>
		<br>
		Managing records requires the same range of aspects as any other management activity such as managing staff or managing money.<br>
		<br>
		We\'ve already established that all UN staff are responsible for making, using and keeping records and this information has been incorporated into the table below.  But what are the other key aspects and who is responsible?  Think about what else is needed and who should be responsible then complete the table below.  Indicate what aspects you think are needed and which of the following groups should be responsible by choosing a group from the list below then compare your answer with the response provided.<br>
