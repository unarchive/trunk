	<h1>Recordkeeping and Retention Schedules</h1>
<br>
Because records contain information about and provide evidence of business transactions they play an important role in every organization on a day to day business.<br>
<br>
But not all information and records have the same value and only a small proportion (less than 10%) make up the future archives on the UN.  Today records include an ever growing and diverse range of data files and databases, word processing files, electronic mail and messages, and other digital text or numeric information which challenges traditional methods of creating, managing and maintaining records.  <br>
<br>
Basic principles and objectives of good recordkeeping are supported by retention schedules which provide practical guidance that can be applied to major groups of records used by many offices. You should use available retention schedules to guide decisions on what to dispose, what to keep and for how long.<br>
   <br>
Let\'s start by considering what a retention schedule is <br>
"A retention schedule is a comprehensive instruction covering the disposition of records to assure their retention for as long as they have administrative, fiscal, legal or research value." ARMS Guide to Services (from UN Website)<br>
<br>
So a retention schedule provides instructions on how long to retain records and the period of retention is determined by the different values records can have.  The term disposition in the definition above includes both transfer to archives and destruction.  An alternative term for destruction is disposal.<br>
<br>
First all records have administrative value i.e. the record is necessary to conduct day-to-day business.  If records do not have administrative value they should not be created as they are redundant.<br>
<br>
Some records, in addition to their administrative value, also have fiscal value where they relate to money received, managed or spent.  Other records have legal value because their creation and existence is required by law or statute.  Finally some records because of the historical information they contain have research value.  <br>
<br>
Let\'s now consider some possible benefits of retention schedules:<br>

- Set Standards: Retention Schedules provide an agreed and consistent standard, across UN departments, missions and offices, on the value and retention of records

- Space: They help limit the number of records held in primary office space and on servers, thereby economizing on storage costs and freeing up storage areas for other purposes

- Retrieval:  They facilitate information storage and retrieval by identifying redundant or unnecessary records for disposal (the less material you have to search through, the quicker the search)

- Shipping: In the case of missions and offices away from HQ, they allow the destruction of records in the mission/office area, saving the office shipping and New York storage costs 

- Protection: They ensure records which need to be kept in the longer term are identified and protected 

- History: They identify potential archival records for regular transfer to ARMS, thereby protecting valuable historical material

	<h1>Developing Retention Schedules</h1>
	<br>
The development of retention schedules should begin with a survey of your records. But it is also important to relate them to your functions and activities, any applicable legal requirements and regulations and of course talk to other colleagues to find out how and for how long they use the records.  The benefit of using the function and activities-based approach is that it is unusual for the functions or activities of an organisation to change in contrast to changes in organisational structure which seem to happen very frequently nowadays.<br>
<br>
You should also consult ARMS as they can provide advice and guidance on retention scheduling and will be involved in the final approval of the schedules.<br>
<br>
Using the function and activities-based approach to identify the records series they produce, the schedule will set out: <br>
<ol>
<li>how long the records should be kept in your active filing area 
<li>the point at which they are destroyed in the office or transferred to the interim archives
<li>how long the records should be kept in the interim archives 
<li>the point at which they are then destroyed or transferred to the permanent archives
</ol>
The retention periods are typically of three types:<br>
<ol>
<li>x number of years e.g. three years after date closed
<li>triggered by an event e.g. end of mission mandate
<li>permanent.
</ol>
In some cases (and it should be a minority) it may be necessary to defer a decision about the retention period by reviewing the records after a fixed period e.g. review after five years.  This instruction is to be used with caution as people asked to do the review may not have first hand knowledge of the records.  It is better to fix a period then review its application and then make any necessary adjustment e.g. to reduce if found that the records were being kept too long or extend if some destroyed records were needed subsequently.<br>
<br>
A retention schedule can also be used to identify vital records i.e. those records which ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster to ensure that they are specially protected.<br>
<br>
If your office has a good record plan, classification scheme or registry in place, the retention schedule will be easy to draft because it is based on record series related to their related functions and activities.<br>

You will see that, in addition to fields listed above, it also includes a number for the schedule to uniquely identify it.  It also clearly indicates the office of record which confirms that it is the records series from this office which are the official records and to which the retention schedule will be applied.<br>

- Retention Schedule for Records Common to Most United Nations Offices (RCUN) applies to all records associated with internal administration or housekeeping activities common to most United Nations offices (for example budget plans and proposals submitted to OPPBA, working and reading files, appointment books).

- RCUN is exceptional since it also gives guidance on non-record copies. Otherwise, schedules usually apply only to the official copy of a record, or "record copy." This allows redundant or convenience copies to be easily identified and also eliminated in a timely fashion

- Financial Rules or Special Audit or other  instructions and restrictions related to the substantive work of your unit.

- Previous guidance provided by ARMS for similar records in your office.
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>	
		Before implementation the retention schedule needs to be approved by ARMS.<br>
<br>
Once your schedule is implemented, you must follow it by retaining your records for the length of time specified and ensuring that they are accessible for the entire retention period. Retention periods apply to information contained in records regardless of media: paper, computer disk or tape, or other format.<br>
<br>
It is best to set up a regular cycle, perhaps annually, for applying the retention instructions.  You should aim to identify those records which are due for action and carry out that action. <br>

Response: You could perform one or more of the following actions:
1.	Transferring records to local semi-current storage (the local archive)	 
2.	Destroying records from the office	 
3.	Transferring records to ARMS (either the interim or permanent archive)

		<h1>Changing Retention Schedules </h1>
		<br>
It is important to have a regular monitoring and review cycle for your retention schedules. In fact, you should regularly review your schedule to ensure it not only covers all your functions and activities and the records they produce but also gives appropriate retention periods. <br>
<br>
The UN/ARMS Records Management Programme Evaluation Tool will assist teams in assessing compliance with ARMS requirements for retention schedules. You can request a change to your schedule by completing a Request for Records Disposition Authorization Form (RMS 49) which can be obtained from the United Nations Intranet. The form requires you to enter the current retention requirements together with a justification giving your reasons for wanting to change the retention schedule<br>
<br>
And finally some key things to remember about retention schedules:<br>
<ul>
<li>Retention schedules are principally timetables which tell you what to do with your older records and when.
<li>ARMS can help with developing retention schedules.
<li>Your retention schedule should be based on your team\'s immediate business needs as well as reflecting any legal, regulatory or other UN requirements.
<li>As your work and your records change, you will need to change your retention schedules.

True
There are a number of regulations, requirements and values considered before retention schedules are finalized to show how long the records need to be kept and which should be kept permanently in the Archives. The following values are taken into consideration:
- Administrative value (means that the record is necessary for conducting day-to-day business)
- Fiscal value (whereby the records establish an audit trail by documenting money received, managed or spent)
- Legal value (means that the records document the rights or responsibilities of the United Nations, or its staff)
- Research value (the records are important for the information that they contain about the United Nations and its activities and are valuable for future programme and policy analysis and documentation of the Organization\'s institutional memory)

False
The most effective record schedules are organised by functions and the record series. Distinct records usually have a separate entry on the retention schedule. Usually all the all the records in a series will have the same value, or put another way, will need to be kept for the same amount of time once the related file is closed
