	<h1>Records creation</h1>
	<br>
Creation is the first stage in the life of any record.  A record by definition is the output of a business transaction.  It provides evidence of a completed business transaction and contains information about the business transaction.  All UN staff create records as part of their work. Nowadays most records are created electronically and live out the whole of their life electronically. <br> 
<br>
Before considering what makes a \'good\' record it is important to confirm the difference between records and documents. <br> 
<br>
Records provide evidence of the organisation, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities of the organisation or because of the informational value of the data in them and are created in a wide range of media.  A records management programme will help you develop an understanding of what needs to be kept as a record to provide information for regulatory, legal, operational and historic purposes. <br>
<br>
Documents are much greater in number than records.  They can be divided into three categories<br>
<ul>
<li>Internal documents which are drafts or works in progress.  These documents do have the potential to become records once they have reached their final form.
<li>UN "official documents" are published UN documents that present information about the official business of the UN.  These are considered as official publications, and are managed by DPI.  These are not considered records in this context.
<li>External documents which UN staff use for reference and as information resources are not outputs of the UN\'s business transactions and so are not considered UN records. 
</ul>
<br>
It is fair to say, then, that all records are documents, but not all documents are records.  Since records provide evidence of UN business, there is a more rigorous process associated with managing them, and this begins with creation.<br>

<h1>What makes a good record</h1>
<br>
Whatever the format, a record needs to have certain qualities or characteristics to be considered a \'good\'record.<br>
<br>
<b>Make a list of the qualities/characteristics you think are necessary to make a \'good\' record</b><br>
<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>
			<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON class="RightButt" OnClick="DisplayAnswerBox(1);" VALUE="Check Response">

			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=20>
- complete i.e. \'good\' records must comprise all required information relevant to the transaction they are recording and all of that information should continue to exist throughout the life of the record. 

- authentic i.e. \'good\' records must be what they claim to be and they must have been created by the person who is indicated as the creator

- reliable i.e. \'good\' records must be created by a creator who has the appropriate authority to create the records. The content must be factually correct with regard to the transaction they represent and be able to be relied upon in subsequent transactions.  The reliability of records increases the nearer in time and space that they are created to the transaction which they represent.

- inviolate i.e. \'good\' records must be fixed and remain unaltered.  Changing an existing record creates a new record. 

- Usable i.e. \'good\' records must be able to be located, retrieved, presented and understood.

<h1>Creating \'good\' records</h1>
<br>
These qualities need to apply whether the record is on paper or in electronic format.  With paper records these qualities can be readily checked and verified. Paper records are physical items which can be organized in sequences and they are also human-readable.  Also the pieces of information about the records, for example, creator, business context, date created are readily visible and are usually incorporated into the record themselves.  For example, with completeness, it\'s easy to see if a page of a letter is missing. The use of headed notepaper with a valid signature can confirm authenticity and reliability.  <br>
<br>
However with electronic records verifying these qualities is more problematic.  It is so easy to change electronic files without leaving any trace and locating, retrieving and being able to present an electronic record relies on hardware and software.  The pieces of information about the electronic record are not human-readable and not all of them will be accurately and automatically created.  For example if someone uses your email account to create a message the message will show them and not you as the creator.<br>
<br>
The bottom line however is that \'good\' records, irrespective of format, need to have the elements and qualities listed. And this means that, in addition to creating the record itself, you need to ensure that the pieces of information about the record are created.  In the electronic environment these pieces of information are called metadata and they describe the content, context and structure of records and their management over time.  They in fact confer \'record-ness\' on electronic records.<br>
<br>
So let\'s look at what metadata are required.  Obvious ones are the record creator and the date of creation but what are the others?<br>
<br>
<b>Make a list of the other metadata required for electronic records</b>
<div CLASS="TextareaBox">
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5> </TEXTAREA><br>
			<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON class="RightButt" OnClick="DisplayAnswerBox(1);" VALUE="Check Response">
		</div>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide1" >
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=8>
- Title (to describe the content)
- Identifier (to uniquely identify the individual record)
- Format 
- Relation
- Disposal/Retention
- Addressee (mandatory for email)

			</TEXTAREA>
</div>
<br>
Within the UN two other items of metadata are mandatory.  These are language and security and access level.<br>
<br>
And finally some key points to remember about records creation:<br>
<ul>
<li>Records creation is necessary to fully and accountably document the business and activities of the United Nations
<li>Creating \'good\' records in paper and digital forms requires good practice and appropriate information technology tools
<li>Knowing when you need to create a record is important.
</ul>
Now assess your learning by going to the test for this module<br>

True.
All UN staff conduct official business and therefore create records which are the evidence of the business they conduct
			</TEXTAREA>

				<b>2.Voice mail messages are not records because they are not written down and they are not kept long.</b>

False. 
Records can be in any format.  Voice mail messaging systems are used to conduct official business and therefore are used to create records
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
				<b>3. Records created at the time the business transaction is carried out tend to be reliable.</b>
		<SELECT class="RightButt"  >
			<OPTION VALUE="0"  SELECTED> </OPTION>
			<OPTION VALUE="1"  >True</OPTION>
			<OPTION VALUE="2"  >False </OPTION>
		</SELECT>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide3">
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5>
True.
The reliability of records increases the nearer in time and space thaty they are created to the transaction which they represent
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
				<b>4. I am a programme manager, records creation doesn\'t concern me, that is my secretary\'s job-she drafts all my memos. </b>
		<SELECT class="RightButt"  >
			<OPTION VALUE="0"  SELECTED> </OPTION>
			<OPTION VALUE="1"  >True</OPTION>
			<OPTION VALUE="2"  >False </OPTION>
		</SELECT>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide4">
			<br>
			<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5>
False.
\'Good\' records are created by the person with appropriate authority to create the records.  Your secretary may generate a memo or email, but the authority and therefore responsibility for the record is yours.
			</TEXTAREA>
		</div>
		<br>
				<b>5. We just had a Section meeting at which we decided to allocate funds to a project.  We just talked at the meeting so there is no record but we don’t need to create one as we can all remember what we decided. </b>

			<OPTION VALUE="2"  >False </OPTION>
		</SELECT>
		<br>
		<div CLASS="AnswerBox" ID="Hide5">
			<br>
		<textarea COLS=80 ROWS=5>
False.  
It is important for accountability purposes to make a record where decisions are taken, particularly when those decisions entail resource allocations.  A brief Note to File or Meeting Minute would suffice.
